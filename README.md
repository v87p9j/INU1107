Word Count (Word Limit)All semester assignments that are written text (e.g., essays, reports) will specify a word limit. The word limit is the maximum number of words that you should write, and it is imposed to ensure fairness when marking each individual student’s work. It is also intended to encourage concise and precise writing, which is a necessary skill in business studies as well as in future employment.In producing your work, you must use a version of Word for Windows. You must accurately state the number of words when you submit each semester assignment. The word count includes all parts of your assignment. However, it does not include the references or the cover sheet.If you exceed the word limit you will be penalised on the following scale:

Grade DescriptorsGrade Descriptors for Undergraduate Summative and Formative Assessment
Class
Mark (%)
Descriptor

First
86-100
Exemplary. Exceptional work showing insight into the topic; reflects a complete grasp of knowledge and understanding. Such work is only rarely encountered.
76-85
Outstanding. Comprehensive knowledge of the topic, showing depth of understanding with evidence of judgement in selection and critical analysis of relevant material. Logically structured and clearly written. 
70-75
Excellent. Detailed knowledge of the topic, with evidence of judgement in selection and critical analysis of relevant material. Well written with good structure. Minor errors acceptable if compensated by excellence in other areas.
Upper Second
65-69
Very Good. Displays good knowledge and thorough understanding of the topic with evidence of broader understanding informed by wider reading. Less critical grasp of the subject than evident in a First-Class answer.
60-64
Good. Reasonably good knowledge and understanding, but little evidence of critical assessment or analysis. Coherent presentation but less well- structured than seen at higher grades.
Lower Second
55-59
Adequate. Sound general knowledge of the subject as taught but lacks evidence of broader understanding. Presented in a satisfactory framework with relevance to the topic retained throughout. 
50-54
Fair. Adequate, except that the work may be rather thin or unimaginative, missing some key points or lacking in clarity.  
Third
45-49
Weak. Exhibits defects such as:
· factually correct, but at an elementary level
· or a narrow selection of material with significant omissions
· or significant errors of fact or understanding
· or muddled, lacking cohesion and direction, or a misguided selection of material. 
40-44
Poor. Typically includes several and sometimes significant defects and is thus barely acceptable. May include very short answers that nevertheless include key points. 
Fail 
35-39
Very poor. A very thin piece of work containing evidence of only rudimentary knowledge of the topic.
30-34
Extremely poor. The work demonstrates little relevant knowledge and/or understanding of the subject.
20-29
Clear fail. Work that misses major elements of the knowledge base. Deserves recognition for making an effort to answer the question or address the essay title but shows very little evidence of knowledge or understanding.
10-19
Serious fail. Significant inability to engage with the question or essay title. Marks are awarded within this range for overall presentation, the odd relevant word in context but negligible evidence of knowledge or understanding.
0-9
Outright fail. Work of very little or no value, or disqualified due to lateness, plagiarism, or other disciplinary offences. · Where relevant, the effectiveness of oral presentation skills (for example focus, presentation structure, audience communication, visual aids) will be considered· For quantitative work, the application of analytical techniques, in addition to attention to detail and interpretation of results where relevant, will be considered.
